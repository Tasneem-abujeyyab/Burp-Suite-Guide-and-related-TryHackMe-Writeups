# OWASP Juice Shop TryHackMe Writeup
🧪 In this walkthrough, we explore the OWASP Juice Shop room on TryHackMe, applying Burp Suite tools like Proxy, Repeater, and Intruder to uncover and exploit common web vulnerabilities. Each step is documented to reflect practical testing strategies. 

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- From Task 3 onward, each challenge will display a flag upon successful completion.
- The web app may take 2–5 minutes to load — be patient.
- If flags aren’t showing:
1. Temporarily disable Burp in your browser’s proxy settings and refresh.
2. For XSS tasks, clear cookies and site data if payloads aren’t working.
3. If you’re confident a task is complete but not marked, check Task 8 for verification.

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. Deploy the VM attached to this room.
2. Access the machine by pasting its IP into your browser (either on the browser-based machine or via OpenVPN).

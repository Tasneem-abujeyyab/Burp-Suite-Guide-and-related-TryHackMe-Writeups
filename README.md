# Burp-Suite-Guide-related-TryHackMe-Writeups
📍 Introduction
Burp Suite is one of the most powerful tools in a web security analyst’s arsenal — and it’s often the first hands-on experience many aspiring professionals have with real-world vulnerability testing. Whether you're exploring injection flaws, broken authentication, or insecure deserialization, Burp gives you the ability to intercept, manipulate, and analyze HTTP traffic like a pro.

This guide is built from my own learning journey — not just theory, but actual practice through TryHackMe rooms, lab walkthroughs, and real debugging sessions. I created it for learners like me: those who want to understand how Burp works, what each feature does, and how to apply it in realistic scenarios without getting lost in jargon.

If you're just starting out or want to sharpen your Burp skills through practical exercises, you're in the right place.
